He did not know who the money belonged to but knew it was not his.\n\n> Instead of reporting the cash deposits to OCBC or the police, Riduan decided to use the money.

In this case, the man knew that the money was not his but proceeded to use it instead of reporting, as stated: \"He did not know who the money belonged to but **knew it was not his**.\".

His 10-year-old son was sitting in the front of the device.\n\n> The victims, a 55-year-old man identified in court documents only as V1 and his 50-year-old wife, were walking home on the pavement along Woodlands Avenue 7 when the man heard the sound of a horn from behind and turned around.\n\n> He saw Yeo riding his PMD with his son in front of him. After Yeo rode past the couple, he told V1 that it was not his father\'s road, the court heard.\n\n> Yeo then alighted from his device with his son and pushed the PMD towards a grass patch before walking angrily towards the couple.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Although his son tried to pull him back, Yeo punched V1 on his jaw. V1 fell to the ground, and Yeo continued to punch him and step on his ribs and groin area.\n\n> Yeo stopped his attack shortly after and left the scene on his PMD, while his son remained behind pleading with V1\'s wife not to call the police. V1\'s wife told him that Yeo had to take responsibility for his actions.\n\n> While they were talking, Yeo returned and swung his fists in the direction of V1\'s wife, kicking at her and trying to hit her. The woman managed to dodge and fled to her husband\'s side.\n\n> V1 was taken to hospital, while Yeo rode away on his PMD. He later admitted to drinking about two bottles of beer before the incident and said he was \"feeling high\" at the time of the offences.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> V1 suffered fractured ribs, bruises, nausea, giddiness and a minor head injury. He was given seven days of hospitalisation leave.\n\n> Yeo pleaded guilty to three charges of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to V1, assaulting his wife and riding a banned PMD on a footpath.\n\n> The prosecutor asked for 16 months and one day\'s jail, saying that \"a strong message needs to be sent to him and other like-minded individuals that such violence cannot be tolerated\".\n\n> For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, Yeo could have been jailed up to 10 years and fined or caned. He could have been jailed up to three months, fined up to S$1,500, or both for assault.\n\n> The penalties for riding a banned PMD are a jail term of up to three months, a maximum fine of S$2,000, or both for a first-time offender. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$5,000, or both.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2021-03-11 12:57:28'),(404,'gqleguc','Doxq','Assault is definitely a crime.

He continued to do so between April and May that year in his bedroom.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Each time before he molested the girl, the offender would show her pornographic videos that he was watching. On one occasion, he asked her to \"follow the video\", and the victim complied.\n\n> Sometime in 2015, the victim\'s mother noticed that the girl was emotional and not her usual self after she returned home from a weekend at her father\'s place.\n\n> She questioned her daughter, who said her father had asked her to lick \"below that thing\", and demonstrated actions suggestive of oral sex.\n\n> The girl\'s mother was shocked and confronted the accused over the phone. He initially denied it but later admitted his acts, promising not to do it again and imploring her not to report the matter to the police.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> The victim\'s mother decided not to make a police report at first, after considering the accused\'s promise and the fact that her daughter appeared distressed and would not be able to see her father in jail.\n\n> She tried to prevent her daughter from seeing her father, but eventually relented as the girl asked to do so.\n\n> The offences came to light only in July 2019, when the girl\'s mother sought help at a family service centre for the victim\'s behavioural issues.\n\n> While discussing the child\'s background, the victim\'s mother revealed that the accused had sexually assaulted the victim, and a police report was lodged.\n\n> The accused was assessed by the Institute of Mental Health after his arrest and was found to be of sound mind, with no psychiatric disorder.\n\n> The victim was examined in a hospital and found to have an old hymenal tear.\n\n> A report showed that she had undergone surgery in October 2015 to remove a plastic toy shoe and another item from her vagina. The victim said she had inserted the items herself.\n\n> MORAL CORRUPTION AN AGGRAVATING FACTOR: PROSECUTORS\n\n> The offender has no previous convictions. Deputy Public Prosecutors Daphne Lim and Lim Shin Hui sought the sentence that was eventually meted out, saying that he had robbed his biological daughter of her innocence by exploiting her for his own sexual gratification.\n\n> One of the aggravating factors is \"moral corruption\", as the man would show his daughter porn before each incident. There was also an escalation in his acts - beginning with molest and proceeding to sexual assault on the third occasion.\n\n> The molestation was of a \"very intrusive nature\", with skin-on-skin contact, said the prosecutors.\n\n> Responding to the defence\'s point that the girl has forgiven her father, the prosecution said this is not relevant in sentencing considerations.\n\n> Defence lawyer Chong Xin Yi said her client had \"stopped himself\" before his ex-wife intervened, and continued to have \"a good father and daughter relationship\" with the victim for four years before his arrest.\n\n> \"The accused has to live with the knowledge of what he has done, and we would submit that that in itself is retribution enough,\" said Ms Chong.\n\n> \"To date he cannot forgive himself for what he has done.

However, he did not complete his studies in Singapore and left the country in July 2014.\n\n> That same month, Lim and his family tried applying to defer NS so that he could pursue university studies, but did not succeed as the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) \"does not usually grant deferment for university studies\", the court heard.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> The Lims were told about the requirement of a bond for an exit permit to be issued, but they were \"unhappy with such a policy\". They did not produce such a bond, and instead continued to try applying to defer Lim\'s NS enlistment in 2014 and 2015.\n\n> After Singapore authorities told Lim\'s father in February 2015 that Lim had to book a date for medical screening in preparation for enlistment, Lim\'s father said his son had already started university studies in the US and would be renouncing his Singapore permanent residency status.\n\n> The authorities replied to tell Lim\'s father to contact the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority if his son wanted to renounce his status.\n\n> Lim returned to Singapore on Jun 2, 2015. He admitted that he complied with the ensuing medical screening because he was worried that he would not be able to enter Singapore for the 2015 Southeast Asian Games held in the country due to his offences.\n\n> He was medically graded fit for enlistment on Jul 7, 2015, but left Singapore that same day for the US and continued trying to apply for deferment.\n\n> He failed to report for enlistment on Nov 11, 2015, and a police gazette was issued against him. He finally returned to Singapore on Jun 11, 2018, after completing his university studies.\n\n> He said he wanted to resolve his NS offences because he intends to swim competitively in Singapore and pursue a career in Singapore in future.\n\n> He enlisted in April 2019 and completed his NS on Feb 2, 2021. On Tuesday, he pleaded guilty to two charges of remaining outside Singapore without a valid exit permit from July 2014 to June 2015 and from July 2015 to June 2018.\n\n> The prosecutor asked for at least two months\' jail, noting the duration of Lim\'s offences, as well as his guilty plea and voluntary surrender.\n\n> TOO FOCUSED ON SWIMMING: LIM\n\n> In mitigation, Lim said he is \"deeply regretful\" of the actions he committed \"as a boy\", adding that he has \"come back to face the consequences as a man\".\n\n> He said he was \"too focused on swimming\" and could not resist the temptation of a scholarship to study at a prestigious university. He added that he had listened to the ill advice of his parents to finish his studies before returning for NS, and said he \"should have nudged them more\" to put his exit permit in order.\n\n> Lim said he was under \"mental stress\" because of this case and is glad he was able to complete NS and serve Singapore. He added that he wished to tell all boys that it is \"beneficial to serve NS\" before finishing university, citing \"leadership skills that young men are exposed to\" that cannot be taught in university.\n\n> He \"strongly encourage(d) young men to look forward to NS and to serve it diligently as it is related to Singapore\'s security\", and said he has decided to be in Singapore.\n\n> He was allowed to begin his jail term on Feb 23. For remaining outside Singapore without a valid exit permit, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$10,000, or both.\n\n> Lim is the 17th person to be jailed for defaulting on NS since the High Court set out a sentencing framework for such offences in 2017.\n\n> In a previous statement, MINDEF said all male Singapore citizens and permanent residents have a duty to serve NS and it is important that NS \"has the support and commitment of all Singaporeans\".\n\n> \"To achieve this, we have to adhere to the fundamental principles of universality and equity in NS. If we allow Singapore citizens or PRs who are overseas to evade NS or to choose when they want to serve NS, we are not being fair to the vast majority of our national servicemen who serve their country dutifully, and the institution of NS will be undermined,\" MINDEF had said.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2021-02-09 10:54:27'),(537,'gmp9j7a','Exofanjongdae','> He said he wanted to resolve his NS offences because he intends to swim competitively in Singapore and pursue a career in Singapore in future. \n\nHmm ok.

It requires patience and sacrifice (from) everyone ... for the greater good.\"\n\n> Prosecutors had called for four weeks\' jail and a S$1,000 fine for Skea, who was working as a tug master in the boat industry and had been deployed overseas for his work. They sought two weeks\' jail for Eyamalai.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> The pair pleaded guilty earlier this month. Skea admitted to two charges of exposing others to risk of infection by leaving his hotel room while on stay-home notice and failing to wear a mask. Another four charges were taken into consideration.\n\n> Eyamalai, who subsequently married Skea, pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiring with Skea to breach his stay-home notice.\n\n> Skea had arrived in Singapore from London on Sep 20, 2020, and was given a stay-home notice which he was to serve in a room at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia hotel. He was told that he could not leave his room nor have any visitors and acknowledged these requirements.\n\n> However, he sent a text message to Eyamalai to tell her he had arrived at the hotel and they agreed to meet each other. Eyamalai booked a room at the same hotel and checked in.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> At 12.52am on Sep 21, 2020, Skea left his hotel room without wearing a mask to scout the premises and find a viable route to get to Eyamalai\'s room.\n\n> However, he got locked out at an emergency staircase and called the hotel\'s reception counter for aid. At about 1am, a hotel employee went to Skea\'s room and helped him to unlock it, noticing that he was not wearing a mask.\n\n> Skea left his room again at 2.22am after a phone call from Eyamalai. He propped open his door with a piece of cardboard before walking up the stairs from the 14th floor to the 27th floor where Eyamalai was waiting.\n\n> They spent the night together in Eyamalai\'s room. Skea left her room at 11.13am and tried to return to his own room, but was stopped by a security officer.\n\n> He lied that he had become stuck when his room door closed accidentally behind him while he was trying to collect food left outside. However, his lie was uncovered when his door was found ajar.\n\n> The couple\'s defence lawyer S S Dhillon said in mitigation that Skea had come to Singapore primarily to marry his fiancee. They did so on Nov 14 last year.\n\n> The lawyer called it \"a classic case of two lovers wanting to be together\".\n\n> The pair could have been fined up to S$10,000 and be jailed for up to six months for each offence.\n\n> Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2021-02-26 07:50:07'),(903,'got6a6e','blackreplica','Maybe his wife can book a cell next door and he can sneak out and go visit her there\n\n*Prosecutors had called for four weeks\' jail and a S$1,000 fine for Skea, who was working as a* ***tug master*** *in the boat industry and had been deployed overseas for his work*\n\nHis work skills should also come in **handy** in while in jail','2021-02-26 08:36:21'),(904,'got6k40','hippopopo_','In the earlier articles, wasn\'t she named a fiancee?','2021-02-26 08:40:44'),(905,'gotvzwi','tom-slacker','NS for Sinkie, ~~Jobs~~ jail for Dua Kee /s','2021-02-26 14:08:02'),(906,'goylc0n','stratint','Poontang must be gooood to do this','2021-02-27 08:11:39'),(907,'gou7p3m','Wowmich','Small head decision overruled big head\'s.

She pleaded guilty to three counts of receiving criminal proceeds, with another 16 charges taken into consideration.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> The defence said the mother of two wanted only to help others out as she is a devout Catholic, and did not take a single cent of the criminal proceeds. She also gave away large sums of her own money to the scammers and has had to take up two jobs despite retiring from a bank years ago and being given a golden handshake.\n\n> Aw, who sobbed repeatedly throughout the hearing, befriended \"Vincent\" on Facebook in 2016. She later agreed to receive and remit money to him on his instructions.\n\n> In December 2016, the police received a report against Aw\'s POSB account, as a victim alleged that they had transferred money to that account as a deposit for a loan that never materialised.\n\n> When Aw was called up by the police for an interview, she was told that Vincent was a scammer and advised against helping him any further. The police also issued her a letter of advisory containing these instructions.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> However, Aw continued to help Vincent over 19 occasions, setting up an OCBC bank account to do so. The victims include people who had turned to loan sharks and were instructed to make repayments to Aw\'s account.\n\n> One victim transferred S$100,000 in total to Aw after being scammed by a man who claimed he needed money to start a business.\n\n> The prosecutor asked for nine months\' jail, saying that the total amount involved across all charges was S$300,000, with at least six victims involved.\n\n> Defence lawyer Cory Wong of Invictus Law asked instead for probation or a fine on his client\'s instructions, citing a medical report that said Aw had mild neurocognitive disorder and may be experiencing the onset of senile dementia.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Mr Wong said Aw is \"gullible and suggestible\" and that the scammers used this to \"condition her into their unwitting money mule\".\n\n> \"There is no evidence to suggest that she pocketed a single dollar and lined her own pockets ... instead, the reality is - she herself lost a lot of money,\" said Mr Wong.\n\n> He said she had received a golden handshake from her previous job for her retirement but has lost all the money. He said his client is \"a very pious Catholic\" who cannot bear to see people suffer in poverty.\n\n> She has no previous convictions and now holds two jobs - at a restaurant and a hotel - to stay afloat, said Mr Wong.\n\n> The prosecutor said the Institute of Mental Health had indicated issues with the medical report relied on by the defence, and added that it is not clear that Aw suffered from dementia at the time of the offence.\n\n> She added that the prisons have indicated that \"they are able to care for any persons with medical and psychological conditions\".\n\n> The judge said she had considered all facts including the plea of guilt, Aw\'s age and medical conditions, and her lack of financial benefit from the crimes.\n\n> Nevertheless, the offences are serious ones, said the judge. She allowed Aw to defer her jail term till after Good Friday and to surrender on Apr 5.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2021-03-05 07:15:06'),(942,'gpr1d7o','AriaKobu007','That\'s unfortunate ?\n\nVincent\'s just going to move on to their next prey while the victim serves jail...','2021-03-05 07:35:46'),(943,'gprfsa5','caritas6','She\'s making such irrational decisions that I\'m not sure she doesn\'t have mental health issues.

She stood near the door and began looking at her phone to pass time on her journey.\n\n> Shen, who was already in the train carriage, stood on the victim\'s right and faced a different direction. About five minutes after she boarded the train, the victim felt something scratching her inner thigh.\n\n> She looked down and saw Shen\'s hand touching her inner thigh over her skirt with a scratching motion.

This was his first brush with the law, he added.\n\n> District Judge Marvin Bay said he was \"mindful of Shen\'s contributions to geo-technological sciences and the construction industry in this country\".\n\n> According to an NUS website, Shen graduated with a bachelor\'s degree in civil engineering from Tsinghua University before obtaining a master\'s and PhD in geo-technical engineering from NUS.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> He was awarded a medal for the best Master of Engineering thesis and received the best young researcher paper award at a seminar in civil engineering.\n\n> Judge Bay also noted the donations Shen made to AWARE after the offence, and noted his clean record and plea of guilt.\n\n> However, he said the offence was committed in the public transport network, and it was \"essential that all commuters should feel safe and protected from unwanted groping, touches, scratches or other acts of molestation while using our public transport system\".\n\n> DONATION NOT A \"GET OUT OF JAIL FREE\" CARD: AWARE\n\n> In response to queries from CNA, AWARE said on Tuesday that it is not uncommon for survivors of sexual violence to request that perpetrators donate to AWARE as a gesture of contrition.\n\n> These donations go towards AWARE\'s work in supporting survivors of sexual assault in Singapore, it said.\n\n> \"At the same time, however, a donation to AWARE should not be viewed as a \'get out of jail free\' card (or in this case, a \'reduction of jail term\' card),\" said AWARE.\n\n> \"Shen’s donation has been used as a mitigating factor in his sentencing, but token payments of this nature shouldn’t be permitted to be suggestive of remorse unless specifically requested by the survivor,\" it said.\n\n> \"Now that we understand the circumstances surrounding Shen’s donation, we are happy to return the amount to him if he wishes,\" it said.\n\n> The group does not disclose individual donation amounts.\n\n> AWARE also said that it was \"disappointed\" to hear that Judge Bay was mindful of Shen\'s contributions to geo-technological sciences and the construction industry during the sentencing.\n\n> \"Shen\'s professional achievements are not relevant and should not be considered in cases where harm has been caused to another person.\"\n\n> For outrage of modesty, Shen could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2021-02-09 16:09:45'),(967,'gmq635p','mrmeowman','You think what, the donation is like “twist!” at the playground is it.

She had booked transport and accommodation expecting him to arrive in Singapore.\n\n> The court heard that Liew came to work in Singapore after graduating with a diploma in business administration in Kuala Lumpur. She worked for electronics component company McCoy for 10 years from 2009 and was promoted in 2015 to accounts manager.\n\n> In her role, she was entrusted with control over the money in the bank accounts of McCoy and its related company iConnexion.

However, Liew rejected him, saying she had a boyfriend.\n\n> Despite this, they continued talking, with Benjamin saying he was a pilot who had flown to Paris and promising to send Liew a parcel with gifts and money.\n\n> He texted Liew on Aug 23, 2019, saying she would receive a parcel from Paris with cash inside and asking for her residential address. She declined at first, but gave her company\'s address out of curiosity.\n\n> A few days later, a person calling himself Kian contacted Liew on WhatsApp, claiming to be from \"Open Wings Global Express Service\". He asked Liew to make payment as the parcel from Benjamin was overweight.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> She transferred S$3,600 from her own savings to a dedicated account provided by Kian. After this, she asked Benjamin what he had sent her. He told her it was a parcel containing 370,000 euros, and she \"felt happy and became greedy\", according to court documents.\n\n> Benjamin later claimed there were other branded items and jewellery in the parcel. Over the next few weeks, Kian continued to ask Liew for more payments for things like taxes and \"security\".\n\n> When she ran out of money in her own accounts, Liew began transferring cash from McCoy and iConnexion to fulfil this purpose. The amounts ranged from S$12,800 to S$80,000.\n\n> Over three months, Liew misappropriated S$1.3 million in total from the two companies.\n\n> \n\n> The director of iConnexion received a call from Western Union in late September 2019, asking for repayments for credit drawn by the company.

They got engaged in February 2019, but their relationship soured soon after. The victim broke off the engagement and ended the relationship in May 2019.\n\n> On Jun 15, 2019, the victim was home alone as her parents had gone overseas. She was unwell and texted the accused as she had to return his belongings to him.\n\n> That evening, the victim went to a mall nearby to buy groceries and was accosted by the offender at her void deck. He insisted on accompanying the victim to the mall, and they argued about their relationship. The victim went home on her own, but left the front door and gate unlocked.\n\n> Even though the victim told the accused not to disturb her and asked him to let her move on, the man entered her unlocked main door and went to her bedroom, shocking her.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> The victim refused his request to get back together and told him to leave her house. In response, the accused - who was 20 at the time - told her he was going to make her pregnant so that she would be obliged to rekindle their relationship.\n\n> When the victim said \"no\" and asked him to leave, the man raped her. After this, the woman went crying to the toilet to wash up, while the accused told her not to cry. He added that he would help her abort the baby if she got pregnant, before leaving the house.\n\n> The victim was very emotionally affected by the incident and feared becoming pregnant. She cried through the night and sent her ex-boyfriend a message saying she wanted to commit suicide, attaching a video that showed her holding a knife between her thighs.\n\n> The next day, she told a friend that her ex-boyfriend had raped her and she might be pregnant. She said she felt like dying and asked why her God did not protect her. Her friend insisted that she make a police report and she did so. The victim did not eventually get pregnant.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> The man pleaded guilty to one charge of rape. Deputy Public Prosecutors James Chew and Grace Teo asked for at least 10 years\' jail and six strokes of the cane, saying that the man had raped the victim \"in the sanctity of her own home with the motive of impregnating her\".\n\n> \"A person’s home is their sanctuary. A woman has a sacrosanct right to her bodily integrity. This case involves a flagrant and deplorable breach of both these inviolable principles,\" they said.\n\n> The offender stating his specific intention to impregnate the victim caused her to suffer \"great fear and emotional distress\", they added.\n\n> For rape, the offender could have been jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2021-02-22 08:21:34'),(1213,'gobozo5','SamBellFromSarang','yet again, this type of psychos also have girlfriends lmao','2021-02-22 09:34:21'),(1214,'gobqp0u','ARealGreatGuy','This psycho probably would have found another way to get to her, but.. who leaves their door and gate unlocked, to sleep, with no one else at home?','2021-02-22 10:01:30'),(1215,'goccov2','CervezaPorFavor','>The victim went home on her own, but left the front door and gate unlocked.\n\nWho does that, especially when you\'re alone at home and just had a very unpleasant encounter with someone who knows where you live??','2021-02-22 14:29:51'),(1216,'gof9yqk','Coronavirus-TypeR','Only 22 years old and permanently marked on the backside ?','2021-02-23 04:09:27'),(1217,'goblz2x','anixouskid','I wish I could unread','2021-02-22 08:47:27'),(1218,'goiwrt9','anixouskid','And we dont? \n:\')','2021-02-24 00:03:03'),(1219,'goc5g69','Shuyi000','Singapore is so safe that we have a unporpotional sense of security','2021-02-22 13:19:38'),(1220,'goeb80j','Book3pper','Maybe she forgot after having to deal with a psycho boyfriend? \n\nIt doesnt give him the right to enter and rape her.

The state cannot bar citizens from entry to the country and also cannot revoke citizenship and render the individual stateless unless he is a naturalized citizen (converted from another nationality).\n\nThe only thing the state can do is to jail/fine/cane the citizen for committing an offence.\n\nSingapore is already very lenient to its PRs.

She was sitting on the floor outside Novotel when an unknown man approached her and asked her to go to a hotel with him, said the prosecutor.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Fithri saw the woman rebuffing the man\'s advances and noted that she did not seem sober. He called out to her from his van, before alighting to speak to her.\n\n> He offered to take her home, saying he was a Grab driver, and she agreed, thinking that he was being kind. She told him she could not walk, and he helped her to her van, where she fell asleep in the rear seat.\n\n> Instead of driving the woman home, Fithri drove to a heavy duty vehicle car park. On the way, he heard the woman say \"must protect me\" twice.\n\n> At about 5am in the car park, Fithri unzipped the woman\'s hoodie and molested her, kissing her face and neck and fondling her.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> The woman woke up and began shouting and begging Fithri to stop. She said she wanted to go home and cried, saying: \"You are supposed to take care of me, you are supposed to take care of me.\"\n\n> After about 20 minutes, Fithri stopped his assault as the woman was trying to open the door to leave. He dressed her and drove to a bus stop where the victim alighted.\n\n> She managed to take a photo of the van, before calling her husband to say she had been molested. Her husband lodged a police report.\n\n> The victim went to a hospital later that day, with the doctor noting that she was visibly distressed and upset and crying intermittently.\n\n> HIGH DEGREE OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Niranjan Ranjakunalan asked for at least 18 months\' jail and three strokes of the cane, citing the high degree of sexual exploitation, the skin-on-skin contact and how the accused had claimed to be a Grab driver performing a public transport service.\n\n> \"He breached the trust of the intoxicated victim by performing various sexually depraved acts against her,\" he said, adding that the offence \"clearly had a toll\" on her.\n\n> Defence lawyer Kalaithasan Karuppaya asked for 12 months\' jail instead, highlighting his client\'s \"charitable nature\", cooperation with the police and early plea of guilt.\n\n> In response, the prosecutor called into question \"this alleged altruism with which (Fithri) approached the victim\" and said he was \"not candid and forthright\" in giving his police statements.\n\n> The judge said there were numerous aggravating factors in the case. He said Fithri had approached the victim \"with less than honourable intentions\" and \"pretended to act as a Good Samaritan\" but preyed on her for \"a considerable length of time\".\n\n> He moderated the jail term slightly after taking into account the plea of guilt, but maintained that caning is clearly warranted in light of the degree of intrusion.\n\n> For outraging the woman\'s modesty, Fithri could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2021-03-08 05:49:23'),(1633,'gq76iq2','lmaolol9011','What a POS.','2021-03-08 11:11:49'),(1634,'l9u5yy','AirconTV','Three years\' jail for woman who joined family members in abusing friend until victim almost died','2021-02-01 03:56:48'),(1635,'glk91o9','lumintus','3 years is too little.','2021-02-01 04:25:20'),(1636,'glk6cxk','AirconTV','What the heck, the jail term does not justify the torment and torture that the victim had went through.

Another two charges were considered.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> The court heard that Sirajudeen, a Singaporean of Indian ethnicity, was a member of a WhatsApp chat group called \"PSP MM Ground Group\", which was used to share information about the 2020 Singapore General Election.\n\n> On Jun 12 last year, Sirajudeen purportedly received an image that depicted information of the racial profile of voters in Marymount Single Member Constituency (SMC). Sirajudeen studied the population profiles in the image, without verifying the data with any official sources.\n\n> Investigations revealed that the polling district boundaries in the image were not accurate, and that the Elections Department did not publish the breakdown of electors by racial groups.\n\n> At about 1.50pm on Jun 13, Sirajudeen sent the image to three men, including two ex-colleagues. He added the following words: \"...it seems the PAP wants to make the Malay community a sub-minority. But the Malays were the original residents of Singapore.\"\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> He also wrote: \"By adding more new China, Indian, Filipino (and) others to just dilute the original race of Malay?\"\n\n> Sirajudeen then asked the men to share the information. But one of them reported the incident to the police, while the other two did not disseminate the messages as requested.\n\n> Sirajudeen later told the police that he had sent the messages to \"create awareness of what he perceived to be a strategy used by the PAP in GE 2020\".\n\n> His messages conveyed his intent \"to stoke fears that the PAP Government was seeking to marginalise the Malays in the country by allowing more immigrants into the country\", said Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Yiwen and Tessa Tan.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Sirajudeen repeated his racially inflammatory behaviour two months later in August, when the police were called over a dispute he had with his neighbour.\n\n> Unhappy with how the officers had handled his complaint, Sirajudeen made two 999 phone calls to complain about the officers.\n\n> During the calls, he said the officers were \"totally of ... unprofessional conduct ... especially the Malay officer\".\n\n> He added that a lot of Malay officers \"cannot go into Air Force\" and said the incident he was complaining about was \"a criminal harassment\".\n\n> \"I don\'t know how (your officers) classify it as non-seizable and they just went out ... is it because of the technicity of the officers attending this ... case? Due to their ... incompetency?\" said Sirajudeen.\n\n> He knew the phone calls were recorded, but stated that he stood by his words. When the police officer on the line tried to verify Sirajudeen\'s contact number, Sirajudeen refused and later asked if the officer was of \"Malay origin\".\n\n> \"Usually, that\'s the case. No worries, no worries. I wouldn\'t blame you, sir,\" said Sirajudeen after learning that the officer is Malay.\n\n> The officer was offended by Sirajudeen\'s remarks, and Sirajudeen was later called up to give a statement to the police.\n\n> Asked to explain the remarks he had made, Sirajudeen said most of the police officers he encountered from \"this denomination\" tended to show bad attitudes.\n\n> He opined that \"Malays are unable to enter the elite forces like the Air Force, Navy or Commando Unit because they are unprofessional\".\n\n> In making such remarks to the police officer, he had intentionally wounded racial feelings and committed an offence while under police investigations for the June incident.\n\n> IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING RACIAL PEACE CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED\n\n> The prosecution asked for the sentence that was eventually meted out, saying that \"the importance of maintaining the racial and religious peace in Singapore cannot be understated\".\n\n> \"A strong deterrent signal must be sent to both the accused and general public that deliberate acts of generating ill will between different racial groups and denigrating other races in Singapore will not be tolerated,\" they said.\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Yiwen said the remarks linked to the General Election were made in an especially sensitive time and the fear-mongering could have affected the foundation of multi-racial Singapore.\n\n> Sirajudeen said he made those remarks during an emotionally charged election period and pleaded for mercy and leniency, adding that he was his family\'s sole breadwinner and has a child with special needs.\n\n> The judge said public interest is very strong in such cases as comments like those made by Sirajudeen could create friction and conflict between different races in Singapore, which cannot be taken lightly in the current security climate.\n\n> This was the first prosecution under Section 298A of the Penal Code for knowingly promoting ill will between racial groups, which is punishable by up to three years\' jail, a fine, or both.\n\n> The maximum penalties are the same for the offence of intentionally wounding racial feelings.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2021-02-08 12:31:59'),(1684,'gmpuntx','condemned02','Because he is not rich Raessah privilege, he got jailed.

The victim boarded the same  bus soon after and sat beside him. \"\n\n  \nYou left out the rather amazing detail that this guy was already out on probation for a previous set of drug ( and other) offences and was actually on the bus because he was going home after leaving Tanglin police division for a urine test. If he was under the influence of drugs while stabbing the victim, he must have either been taking drugs prior to meeting the mata at Tanglin or he must have been happily taking his drugs after his urine test. Either outside the police HQ, inside the police HQ toilet or on the bus.  It basically means that the drugs were in his urine, or on his person when he was at Police HQ. It really sounds like our anti drug campaign is working very well.../s  \n\n\nAlso this guy sounds like a champion specimen of humanity. \n\n  \n\" some singaporeans srsly brainwashed to think the victim deserves it. \"   \n\n\nIts like rural bible belt America in the 80s. Or like Russia. In this case, the court basically accepted the gay panic defense, siding with these people. We have:   \n\n\n\\-a repeat offender.\n\n\\-Who clearly is not obeying the terms of his probation, having just come from bringing drugs (either in him or out) through police HQ.\n\n\\-Convicted of a new set of serious offences that include voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon ( which alone can carry 7 years in prison+ caning).  \n\n\n\\-Nearly killed someone in an unprovoked attack. Unlike a lot of activities we severely punish people for, this crime has a real victim who may suffer for a long time after this attack\n\n\\-who at 20 years old is nearly at age limit for reformative training and is comfortably eligible for prison.  \n\n\nI am how exactly this qualifies for 1 year reformative training is beyond me. It is really fucked up.   \n\n\nMoral of the story kids: if your victim is LGBT, the court will forget everything else and give you a slap on the wrist. They will even forget about your drugs, something they are normally so draconian about.

The molestation began in 1994, and in 1999 when the victim was 12, the man molested the girl when she asked him to help her with some medication.\n\n> The victim grew accustomed to the sexual abuse over the years, believing that her only way out was \"to either end her life or wait until she turned 35 years old to move out to her own flat\", the court heard.\n\n> When she told her brother about the abuse in 2013, he suggested that she lock her bedroom door. She began doing so and this reduced the instances of abuse, but her stepfather would force his way in as the lock was faulty.\n\n> In February 2017, when the victim was 29, her mother was admitted to hospital and her stepfather preyed on her when they returned home.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> She resisted and texted her brother to tell him what was happening, saying she was \"scared and wanted to die\".\n\n> The offender stopped his acts only when the victim\'s friend called her and talked loudly on the phone. The victim later made a police report.\n\n> The victim was assessed and found to have experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, coping with \"self-talk\" by reminding herself that her stepfather had not raped her.\n\n> She also distracted herself with work and kept her mother\'s needs for finances and companionship in mind.\n\n> Her stepfather told investigators that he felt the urge to touch the victim when she was going through puberty, feeling \"tempted\" after seeing her naked when he was helping her with the medication, and said he was not having regular sex with his wife.\n\n> The prosecutor had asked for the maximum sentence of 10 years\' jail and an additional seven-and-a-half months\' jail in lieu of caning, while the defence asked for six years and 10 months, calling the prosecution\'s submitted sentence \"crushing\".\n\n> The lawyer added that his client had been a victim of sexual abuse himself for about five years from the age of 15, when a man abused him.\n\n> Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg.

Another 34 similar charges were taken into consideration.

I\'m the above poster and I used \"men and boys\" precisely because OP used \"ladies and girls\"  ? I wouldn\'t have bothered replying if he hadn\'t put this responsibility of preventing voyeuristic crimes squarely on our gender. And I\'m glad to see that he is being downvoted to negative.\n\nYou need to chill as well. No one is suggesting that we have zero responsibility to look after our safety. It needs to go both ways. I have already responded to you above and I\'ll say it here again. Voyeuristic crimes are not comparable to things like robbery. You can see a robber. You can protect yourself from a robber doing specific things (locking up your house). But you can\'t see a voyeur. An invisible enemy is much more frightening.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nThe redittor above you did not go overboard. Victim-blaming is the right phrase. Sure, suggesting that people need more awareness may not be as blatant as \"don\'t wear a skirt\". But think about it. If the OP said that women and girls need to be educated on being vigilant, that *is* putting the responsibility on us and if we fail to be educated, then it somehow becomes our fault.\n\nAnd, what about if we\'re educated? Let\'s say I\'m aware of these camera shoes, so I go around everywhere looking at my feet, but I got carried away chatting with a friend on a crowded train and missed the suspicious man next to me and he\'s now got an upskirt photo of me on his camera shoe. So I\'m already educated, but I got careless and became a victim. Am I partially at fault because I was educated and I still let it happen? I don\'t think that\'s fair right?\n\nIf you re-read at OP\'s post again, it\'s really the way he framed his entire point, that rubs women the wrong way and implies victim-blaming. If he\'d said something along the lines of \"good for women to be educated about these crimes so that it will hopefully make it easier for them to identify and report these offenders.\" It makes such a world of a difference!','2020-12-13 02:34:52'),(2664,'k17a8t','dontbother111','Woman gets jail for pouring hot water on boyfriend\'s groin on cheating suspicions','2020-11-26 03:17:41'),(2665,'gdmlits','prime5119','>Zareena entered into a relationship with the victim, a married man, in 2006.

His shots damaged the windows of nine neighbours.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Lee Keng Hee, 64, was jailed for 18 weeks and fined S$2,000 on Wednesday (Dec 16). He pleaded guilty to one count of manufacturing an airgun under the Arms and Explosives Act and another charge of committing a rash act by shooting ball bearings with the gun. Two other charges were considered in sentencing.\n\n> The court heard that Lee came across a toy gun at a mall in 2017 and bought it to study its firing mechanism. He tried to reverse-engineer its mechanism and make his own airgun, but was unsuccessful.\n\n> He decided to make his own from scratch and was determined to make one that was more powerful than the Nerf guns. After settling on making an airgun made of metal that could fire steel ball bearings, Lee began studying airgun-making tutorials on YouTube.\n\n> He used discarded scrap metal from his company\'s workshop and assembled the components ranging from the air chamber to the barrel to form the airguns.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Lee encountered difficulties constructing his first airgun in late 2017, and began making the second one incorporating the use of a bicycle air-pump valve. He completed both guns in mid-2018 and tested them in his home by shooting ball bearings at a cardboard box.\n\n> He further conducted test shots with the second gun at the trees planted about 10m to 15m from his block, positioning himself at his living room window.\n\n> When the second gun spoiled with use, Lee began manufacturing a third airgun, which he hoped to be more powerful and consistent than its predecessors. He took about three months to make this gun, with a bigger air chamber, and tested it first with a cardboard box in his flat.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> He later used the trees as target practice and moved on to shooting at other Housing Board blocks to determine the range of this third airgun.\n\n> Between September 2018 and April 2019, Lee used his airguns to shoot metal ball bearings from his eighth-floor flat towards neighbouring blocks on at least nine occasions.\n\n> Nine of his neighbours had damaged windows as a result of Lee\'s shooting. On the night of Apr 3 last year, one of them called the police about a crack in his bedroom window.\n\n> Lee was arrested after extensive investigations of the surrounding blocks, and his home-made airguns and component parts seized.\n\n> An assessment found that ball bearings shot from one of Lee\'s guns could cause non-lethal injuries if aimed at a person, and could crack window glass.\n\n> A HIGH DEGREE OF PERSISTENCE\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Regina Lim asked for at least four months and six weeks\' jail and a fine, saying the airguns Lee manufactured were inherently dangerous, with extensive firing ranges and significant firing power.\n\n> He also displayed \"a high degree of persistence in manufacturing his airgun\", taking 10 months to make the three weapons. In total, he shot at least 200 6mm ball bearings while manufacturing the arms.\n\n> Lee also shot his airsoft gun nine times towards occupied residential blocks and damaged the windows of nine flats, costing owners about S$2,000 to repair.\n\n> Defence lawyer Favian Kang asked instead for \"a short imprisonment term and a small fine\", saying that his client had voluntarily made restitution, selling off his late mother\'s jewellery to do so.\n\n> He also cooperated with the police and assisted them with sketches and inquiries, said the lawyer. Lee is the sole breadwinner of the family and resigned from his job before the hearing, he added.\n\n> For manufacturing an airsoft gun, Lee could have been jailed for up to three years and fined up to S$10,000.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2020-12-16 07:54:34'),(2721,'gg0lvvx','rynthms','Complete kit\n\n*sees the film canister* oh hell naw','2020-12-16 09:23:55'),(2722,'gg3xksu','PanzerSoul','I\'m not even mad, that\'s amazing','2020-12-17 04:18:15'),(2723,'gg0t0mb','DifficultyExtension5','射手槍是不對的','2020-12-16 11:28:53'),(2724,'gg8hjyf','You_cant_see_dis','ST Engineering: bro you want a job?','2020-12-18 09:06:45'),(2725,'gg4sj46','JZ5U','His only mistake was shooting at windows (probably due to bullet deviation).

She started to complain about cigarette smoke in the flat, demanding that her parents find its source and making them fan away the smoke with cardboard and purchase powerful fans.\n\n> Tan and his wife did whatever necessary to pacify Ms Tan, apologising to her and bowing before her. On one occasion, at the urging of his wife, Tan slapped his wife in front of their daughter to appease her.\n\n> On Oct 22, 2018, Tan took his daughter to Changi General Hospital for her distress over the cigarette smoke and she was diagnosed with unspecified anxiety disorder.\n\n> However, she declined psychiatric medication \"over self-perceived fears of psychological dependence on it\".\n\n> She was discharged a day later and moved to her aunt\'s place to escape the smoke, but continued her \"overbearing behaviour\" towards her parents, asking them to transfer money to her, the court heard. She also told her father to drive more frequently to earn more money.\n\n> Ms Tan\'s mother could not handle her, leaving it to her husband to tackle their daughter\'s behaviour and demands.\n\n> \"The accused felt very stressed by the deceased’s constant demands and scolding. He felt that she had caused both him and his wife to be almost on the verge of committing suicide,\" said the prosecution.\n\n> On the morning of Nov 19, 2018, Tan fetched his daughter from her aunt\'s home as she had instructed him the day before. He cancelled any Grab bookings he had as she instructed, and arrived at the home with boxes for her belongings.\n\n> As he was helping her pack, his daughter scolded him for coming late and being a \"lousy\" parent, and Tan apologised to her before driving her to a mall for lunch.\n\n> During lunch, Ms Tan continued nagging and scolding her father, clenching her fork tightly and saying that she felt like killing him with it.\n\n> Tan was frightened and kept apologising to her. When they got back to the Bedok flat, Ms Tan went to the kitchen.\n\n> THE INCIDENT\n\n> Afraid that his daughter might take something from the kitchen to harm him, Tan went to his son\'s former bedroom and took a metal pole from a partially dismantled drum set to arm himself.\n\n> He went to the kitchen with the pole and saw his daughter holding a knife and pointing it at him.\n\n> Tan hit his daughter with the pole until she fell to the floor, before taking a nearby cloth and pressing it down on his daughter\'s neck.\n\n> After a while, he realised she had stopped moving and released his grip, feeling shocked at what he had done.\n\n> He called the police, before calling his brother and calling the police a second time to say: \"I just killed my daughter. I grab the pole and whack her. I think she die already.\"\n\n> Police arrived to see Tan in a crouching position at the entrance to the kitchen, with his daughter lying motionless on the kitchen floor. The towel was on her neck, while the knife and pole were nearby.\n\n> She was pronounced dead, with an autopsy finding her cause of death to be strangulation.\n\n> Tan was remanded for forensic psychiatric assessment and found to be suffering from a major depressive episode at the time of the crime, which substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts.\n\n> He felt that his daughter had placed himself and his wife \"under such mental torment as to drive them to commit suicide\", the court heard.\n\n> The psychiatrist also found that Tan had significant caregiver stress at the time of the offence, and both this and his depressive episode qualified Tan for a defence of diminished responsibility.\n\n> A TRAGIC CASE: PROSECUTOR\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Bhajanvir Singh asked for three years\' jail, calling it a \"tragic case\" and agreeing with the defence that \"this case deserves some sympathy\".\n\n> \"The accused was a doting father who was the deceased\'s main caregiver,\" said Mr Singh, adding that the victim\'s various psychiatric conditions had placed \"tremendous stress\" on the family.\n\n> Due to this stress, Tan was later diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and significant caregiver stress, both of which contributed to the offence and led to him taking the life of the deceased, \"whom he loved dearly\".\n\n> Defence lawyer Derek Kang asked for two years and nine months\' jail, saying that his client had used a metal pole in the attack but said this was because his daughter was holding a knife.\n\n> She had also told him during lunch that she felt like killing him, which was a direct death threat, said Mr Kang.\n\n> \"Ultimately, whatever sentence Your Honour decides, is not going to be a greater punishment than he has already suffered for killing his beloved daughter,\" he added.\n\n> Justice Hoo Sheau Peng said this was a tragic case as agreed by both sides.\n\n> JUDGE FLAGS IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES\n\n> \"From all accounts, Mr Tan, you have been a selfless, loving and devoted father,\" she said, adding that he spent years caring for a daughter who suffered from psychiatric conditions but refused treatment.\n\n> She pointed to the defence\'s point that this case serves \"as a stark reminder about the importance of mental health issues and families needing to stay alert\" to such issues developing or affecting family members.\n\n> She said it was critical for society to enhance access to treatment for mental health issues and said it was \"unfortunate\" that the Tan family did not seek or was not given much help, support and intervention for Ms Tan and later her father.\n\n> She said Tan is now responding to treatment and urged him to comply with his treatment plan, and for his family to support him in the process.\n\n> She said that while Tan will no doubt continue to suffer pain and anguish for what he has done, she hopes the family will in time come to terms with what has happened and find closure.\n\n> Tan cried and said he understood, thanking the judge and all involved: \"Thank you everybody. May God bless all of you.\"\n\n> For culpable homicide not amounting to murder, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or both. He cannot be caned as he is above 50.\n\n> Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg.

The fall, however, was severe enough that they suffer lethal traumatic brain injury. That\'s self-defence and you can get out of it with a good coroner\'s report.\n\nHowever, if you disarm them, wrestle them to the ground, put one knee over their throat and do a coup de grace stab using the same knife, or your own knife to the assailant\'s chest, well, that\'s going overboard, and a murder/assault charge.\n\nStand your ground laws are important when it comes to firearms and usually firearms only. Why? Well, firearms escalation is very quick and the weapon is very lethal. In the case of someone lunging with a knife and it is reasonable that your life is in immediate danger, you drawing your gun and fire twice center mass is not unreasonable. The forensics team may see a dead assailant with two bullet holes on the walls. What is unreasonable is once the target is on the floor, clutching the bullet wounds and dropping his/her knife, you empty the rest of the gun into the assailant\'s body plus one more in the head. The forensics then count 6 bullets holes on the floor and it\'s not unreasonable for you to get a second degree murder charge (passionate, heat-of-the-moment, unplanned murder).\n\nIf you actually leave the scene, go to the next room, then return with a different gun, then empty it into the no-longer-assailant on the floor, ... that\'s first-degree pre-meditated murder.\n\nSomeone robbing you at knifepoint with the knife on your chest and you shoot, that\'s self-defence. They turn and run away and you shoot in their backs to get your stuff back, that\'s not self-defence and it\'s assault/murder. Lives > property.\n\nIn this case, well, if the target is already on the ground and no longer has access to the knife, and evidently during the strangulation, the man was not in danger of being stabbed, that\'s where self-defence ends.

LTC/SLTC is where exit outcomes diverge the most based on the regulars I know. You have farmer guys who planned their exit strategy shrewdly with smart investments, learning about the outside world and networking, so they adjusted well to the new inter-personal dynamic, got into a good job (ie. in the corporate world not propped up by proximity to SAF: ie. not languishing in ST) and had money to maintain a very comfortable lifestyle. You also have guys that flounder and get outcomes that don\'t seem commensurate with the rank and power they previously achieved over so many men. The problem is when you haven\'t been promoted enough or rotated across a diverse range of appointments that give you a chance to interact beyond the SAF silo, and you never made the effort to seek it out yourself. This is exacerbated by the age; unlike CPT/MAJ, you didn\'t leave quite early enough to build a second career as relatively easily, there is a lot of lost time and stagnation in skills and exposure to make up for as time went you by in the SAF. A lack of humility, myopic worldview and general ignorance makes it worse. If anything, that distinguishes the exiting LTCs/SLTCs that make it and are not defined by their army service, from those that continue their streak of mediocrity from the SAF.\n\nAt the COL/BG level, you would typically be exposed enough to broader policy and matters outside the SAF in the course of your work sufficiently to transition painlessly, even if its just a senior position somewhere adjacent like ST. Even more so if you\'re a scholar and/or seconded elsewhere. Arguably, you are that rank *precisely* because someone trusts you in that position of exposure and operating across a broad domain, and you are given significantly more *institutional support* for the transition because the powers that be *want you* to be in higher positions for the sake of continuity, predictability and channelling your skills and experience down a path that gives you the best chance of exercising them.','2020-10-07 05:27:01'),(3051,'g7z4v2p','ThrowNeiMother','Maybe not CEO, but definitely quite a few do join upper management. 69 liao probably most of his savings gone','2020-10-07 05:05:37'),(3052,'g7zmvmk','troublesome58','69 years old should be under pension scheme?','2020-10-07 10:26:20'),(3053,'g7yseqv','None','[deleted]','2020-10-07 02:49:07'),(3054,'g7z3tyl','milkmatchatea','bitchslap can RSO?','2020-10-07 04:52:04'),(3055,'g7yobaf','hellowakiki','Dunno leh, not doctor \n\nBut it’s probably dependent on severity.

They needed a boat to take them to a location in Singapore waters, where they would transfer to a foreign boat.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Due to travel restrictions caused by COVID-19, they were unable to visit their families in Indonesia so they decided to go via Batam island.\n\n> Arman, who worked as a steersman manoeuvring the craft to transport goods for a company, agreed to help. He knew that his brother has a family in a village in Batam - although Aqib is not legally married there - and had been travelling between the two locations frequently before the pandemic hit.\n\n> In the wee hours of Oct 30 last year, Arman steered his vessel from Marina South Pier towards a location in the sea south-east off St John\'s Island.\n\n> He deliberately turned off his transponder to avoid detection by the Police Coast Guard, and was instructed to time his departure to coincide with the Indonesian boat that would be waiting to pick the men up.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> At around 1.20am, the boat from Indonesia stopped beside Arman\'s craft, and Aqib and Sodikin jumped in. The boat sped off towards Batam, but Arman was arrested soon after by the Police Coast Guard, which had detected an unknown vessel in the water.\n\n> Aqib later returned to Singapore through Kusu Island in late November last year and was arrested. He was given two months\' jail in December. Sodikin was also nabbed after returning to Singapore and is currently remanded, pending his court case.\n\n> Arman asked for a second chance, saying that he hoped he would not be imprisoned for too long and that he had a sick wife in Johor Bahru.\n\n> \"I know I was wrong and I attempted to explain this to ICA (Immigration and Checkpoints Authority) the other day,\" he said through an interpreter. \"I did not do this for the money, I just wanted to help. I know what I did was wrong.\"\n\n> For abetting a person to leave Singapore by an unauthorised departure point, he could have been jailed between six months and two years, and fined up to S$6,000.\n\n> For deliberately turning off the transponder on his vessel, he could have been fined up to S$20,000.\n\n> Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2021-01-09 08:02:38'),(3238,'giqpt5d','Orangecuppa','COVID ma.

He found out the pen’s true nature after dismantling it.\n\n> Using two spy pens that he bought online for about $20 to $30 each, the man would enter the toilet before his victims to plant the devices with the lens angled towards the shower area. He would leave the devices in recording mode, targeting female friends and a tenant who stayed at his home. After he recorded the victims, the man would retrieve the spy pens and view the videos.\n\n> He admitted to taking the videos for fun, although he knew it was wrong.\n\n> One of the victims was the girlfriend of the man who found the spy pen, while another was the accused’s close female friend of seven years.\n\n> The man pleaded guilty to two charges of insulting the modesty of the two women in 2017 and a charge of possessing 14 obscene films in his phone and an external hard drive.\n\n> Another three charges involving two other female victims were taking into consideration for his sentencing.\n\n> All victims cannot be named due to a gag order protecting their identities.\n\n> The man’s close female friend, 26, often visited his house. On one occasion in July 2017, she went to his house for a co-curricular activity meeting. Unbeknownst to her, the man planted a spy cam in his toilet to take videos of his female friends. He captured the victim showering in a video, which lasted eight minutes.\n\n> On the afternoon of 2 September 2017, the man, his male friend, and a few female friends visited a mutual friend who stayed at a condominium to swim. After swimming, at about 6pm, the group headed to the condominium unit to shower.\n\n> It was agreed that the women would use the front toilet while the men used the back toilet. The man decided to use this opportunity to install his spy pen in the front toilet to video the women showering.\n\n> While in the unit, the man’s male friend spotted the man emerging from the toilet and asked him why he was there. However, the man did not reply.\n\n> The friend felt uneasy as he saw the man carrying a black sling bag after he left the toilet. The friend decided to check the toilet. Although he did not see anything suspicious, he found a pen in the toothbrush holder.\n\n> The man dismantled the pen and found that it had a camera and an SD card. He kept the pen.\n\n> The next morning, he told his girlfriend, 26, about the pen and they both reviewed the SD card and discovered its contents. The pen contained a nine-minute video capturing the girlfriend fully naked while showering.\n\n> The friend and the victims confronted the man on 11 September but he denied the offence and lied about it. After finding more spy devices in the man’s residence, the group decided to lodge a police report.\n\n> The man’s electronic devices were seized the next day and 14 obscene videos were unearthed through forensic examination.\n\n> Sentencing the man, District Judge Adam Nakhoda agreed with the prosecution that there were serious aggravating factors in this case, including a “high degree of planning and premeditation”.\n\n> “The accused had procured spy cameras and had a thought-out modus operandi which involved him planting the spy cameras in the toilet and angling it towards the shower area,” said the judge.\n\n> There was an element of abuse of trust as the man knew the victims and the offence had occured while the offender and victims gathered. There was also a “very high level” of intrusion as the victims were captured fully naked and with their faces exposed.\n\n> “There is potential for dissemination and had the videos been distributed, these would have been all the more devastating,” noted DJ Nakhoda. The judge considered mitigating factors, such as the man’s cooperation with the police, his plea of guilt, and that he was unlikely to reoffend.\n\n> The judge also factored a small discount into Lee’s sentence given that his case was delayed.\n\n> For insulting the modesty of a woman, Lee could have been jailed up to a year, or fined, or both.\n\n> For possessing an obscene film, he could have been jailed up to six months and/or fined up to $20,000.\n\n> Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore\'s Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore\n\n> Other Singapore stories\n\n> 4 women, 6 men charged for meeting at Arab Street club during circuit breaker period\n\n> Man gets 17 years\' jail, 24 strokes for sexually assaulting girlfriend\'s daughters\n\n> Ghostbuster: Seeking answers from spiritual realm amid COVID-19 pandemic\n\n> 14 e-cigarette peddlers convicted, fined total of $255,000\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2020-11-10 08:58:15'),(3411,'gbth987','99butterfly','Bastards like these need to be named so future employers will know not to hire them :(','2020-11-10 11:36:02'),(3412,'gbwfkvb','foxtailavenger','Good thing he wasn\'t too bright.

He added that her mother\'s breasts were small and he was not satisfied, and the girl resisted his advances.\n\n> However, the man continued to say that he could not control his dreams and that he \"cannot tahan (withstand) already\". He sat on the bed and moved closer to the victim.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> After the victim repeatedly denied him, the man got up and told her not to tell her mother about the incident, before leaving.\n\n> When her mother got home, the victim told her what had happened, saying she was scared. Her mother grew agitated, told her not to be scared as she would find ways to resolve the situation, and confronted the accused.\n\n> The offence was not discovered at the time, even though the victim put up a private Instagram post about it. The victim and her mother left the offender\'s flat in July 2018, and the couple divorced about a year later.\n\n> The incident came to light only after the victim\'s mother lodged a police report over the offender breaching a personal protection order she had against him, and the victim recounted the incident to an investigation officer.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> In his defence, the man claimed that the offence did not happen and that his ex-wife had conspired with the victim to frame him so she could obtain a divorce.\n\n> He also claimed that his ex-wife did so to obtain a larger share of the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial flat and that the victim had made the Instagram post to \"attract attention\".\n\n> In response, the prosecution said there was a range of reasons for the victim\'s mother wanting a divorce, including the offender\'s extra-marital affairs, physical abuse and his refusal \"to have conjugal relations on numerous occasions\".\n\n> For insulting a woman\'s modesty, the man could have been jailed for up to a year, fined, or both.

Another three charges were taken into consideration.\n\n> The court heard that Wong\'s wife obtained a personal protection order against him in January 2018, after a fight. Under the order, Wong was restrained from using violence against her.\n\n> On May 4 last year at about 3am, Wong quarrelled with his wife over financial issues.

The kitten stopped moving and Wong put it in the kitchen bin.\n\n> His wife remained awake for the rest of the night as she was afraid, and later took her children with her to her mother\'s house.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Wong later threw the bag containing the kitten down the 11th-floor flat\'s rubbish chute. The animal is now presumed dead.\n\n> Separately, he robbed a 17-year-old of his S$1,000 phone on Jun 25, 2019, along with S$500 cash. Wong had boarded a bus from Sembawang MRT station and gone to the upper deck, where the victim was seated.\n\n> Wong carefully concealed a curved karambit knife in his shirt so that the victim would see it without drawing the attention of other passengers. He then sat beside the teen, showing his knife to him, and asked for his phone.\n\n> The teenager eventually handed over his phone and S$500 in cash, and later made a police report.\n\n> HE IS RECALCITRANT: PROSECUTOR\n\n> The prosecutor asked for a sentence of four years and 10 weeks\' jail and six strokes of the cane. The offence of robbery with a deadly weapon alone carries a mandatory minimum sentence of two years\' jail and six strokes of the cane.\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Daniel Ling said Wong is a recalcitrant offender with many previous convictions including snatch theft and robbery.\n\n> He also said stiff sentences are in line with policies to develop stronger measures against cruelty to animals, and called the ill-treatment of the kitten \"unjustifiable, egregious and uncalled for\".\n\n> Not only did Wong cause the kitten\'s head to bleed, he also threw it on the floor so that its blood spattered on the floor, before throwing it down the garbage chute.\n\n> While the kitten was not found, it is likely to have died when it was thrown down the chute. It had done no harm to Wong, who \"vented his anger on the kitten over a dispute with his wife\".\n\n> The offence against his wife was also conducted \"in blatant disregard\" of the personal protection order filed against him, said Mr Ling.\n\n> Defence lawyer Jonathan Wong said his client was \"profoundly remorseful\" and \"painfully aware\" of what the sentence will mean for himself and his wife and two children.\n\n> He said his wife is \"committed to supporting him through this difficult period\", and said the animal cruelty and arguments with his wife were consistent with a \"period of difficulty\" Wong had been going through.\n\n> \"He\'s committed to making every effort to reshape his future, (with) his wife and his two young children being the primary, if not only, goal that he has going forward,\" said the lawyer.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)','2020-10-22 08:35:58'),(3509,'g9mye0t','janc1111','\"Don\'t fuck with cats\"','2020-10-22 11:30:29'),(3510,'g9n7kyd','Icy_Squirrel_2155','What a despicable man','2020-10-22 13:19:44'),(3511,'g9qe60y','jennyjoneslee','\"the animal cruelty and arguments with his wife were consistent with a \"period of difficulty\" Wong had been going through.\"\n\nA period of difficulty sounds like a shit excuse for being a walking tau gey','2020-10-23 05:36:58'),(3512,'g9mubeg','lupCheong','Without people like these, our vaunted SPF would be out of a job.','2020-10-22 10:24:37'),(3513,'g9ms3hi','cambeiu','Had he thrown a foreign maid instead, he would not have been caned.','2020-10-22 09:43:59'),(3514,'g9o0pka','minerboy662','no one should do this to any animals* actually\n\n*does not include cockroach and mosquito','2020-10-22 17:26:41'),(3515,'g9o3cqb','pm_me_pm_speeches','I don\'t understand why such an order would exist.
